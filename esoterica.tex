The universe of topological spaces is very large, and it includes some \defn{beasts}.
These beasts exhibit some very strange behavior, at least from the standpoint of the  topological spaces we construct from Euclidean spaces and finite sets.
These are sometimes called \defn{pathological topological spaces} or just \defn{pathologies}.
They are useful as counterexamples to certain implications in the world of topology, but their importance should not be overestimated.
